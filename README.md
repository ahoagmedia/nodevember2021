# **Nodevember 2021 - AHM Blender Files**

Blender 3D files from Nodevember 2021 created by Andrew Hoag.

You can find more of my work at https://ahoag.media.

Please note, some of these files utilize the incredible Advanced Geometry Nodes Groups by [Erindale Woodford](https://twitter.com/erindale_xyz). They were nice enough to give me permission to post files utilizing their node groups, so if you like what you see in these project files, please support them and purchase a license for yourself [here](https://blendermarket.com/products/erintools) on Blender Market. It's only $17.00 and worth every penny.
